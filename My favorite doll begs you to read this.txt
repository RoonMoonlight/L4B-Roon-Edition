# Welcome to jokingly styled readme.txt #
#=-------------------------------------=#

If you are reading this then you wanted to install this little script which I use. Right?

Please do note that this is made for myself and not really intended to be used with everyone.
If you wish to modify for yourself feel free to do so.

Additional note: You need to install Left 4 Bots and Left 4 Libs first before installing.
Links to the both mod can be found here:
Left 4 Bots - https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2279814689
Left 4 Lib - https://steamcommunity.com/workshop/filedetails/?id=2634208272

To install, copy the ems folder to 'C:\Steam\steamapps\common\Left 4 Dead 2\left4dead2'. Overwrite if asked.
Note: If you are installing on Linux put the directory on '~/.steam/Steam/steamapps/common/Left 4 Dead 2/left4dead2'.

Warning: If you are using your own custom configuration for Left 4 Bots, please back up your Left 4 Bots configuration file before doing so.
Roon is lazy and I am not responsible for ignoring this warning.

Have fun.
